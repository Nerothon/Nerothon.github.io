<h3>What are pet jewels</h3>
<div>
    Every pet unlocks an empty Star shaped jewel socket at Ancient level a.k.a. Pet Jewel Collar. In this socket you can socket a 6th pet ability of your choice.
</div>

<h3>Ability and jewel availability</h3>
<div>
    Most talents and derby powers have an equivalent Jewel that grants that ability. <br>
    Some abilities can be only socketed in and not manifested directly. <br>

    There are even some premium Jewels that grant 2 talents at the same time. This type of jewels can only be acquired with real money. <br>
    Either by:

    <ul><li>Buying Scroll of Fortune and getting enough points to reach the goal that grants that jewel as a reward.</li>
        <li>Buying Crowns/Membership gift cards.</li></ul>

    Most popular choice of such jewels are jewels you get as a bonus from $20 Kroger gift cards.
</div>

<h3>Level requirements</h3>
<div>
    Each Star jewel has a pet level requirement. Usually, the stronger the talent, the higher the pet's level needs to be in order for you to be able to socket it.

    For example:
    <ul><li>Storm-Boon talent grants only +3% Storm Damage and its jewel requires level Ancient+.</li>
        <li>Storm-Dealer talent grants +10% Storm Damage and its jewel requires level Ultra+.</li></ul>

    This means that ideally you want to manifest talents whose jewels require Ultra+ so you won't need to take the pet to Ultra+ and then socket the 6th talent you want that requires only Ancient+, Epic+ or Mega+.
</div>

<h3>Jewel interactions with regular pet abilities</h3>
<div>
    You can't socket a talent that the pet has already manifested. <br>

    If you socket a Talent at Ancient or Epic, this doesn't prevent the talent from manifesting on the pet when you level up the pet. <br>
    If the pet manifests the same talent that the socketed jewel grants, the jewel will X/cancel out and will no longer grant any benefit. Only the manifested talent will. After that, you will have to take the jewel out and replace it with a different one.
</div>

<h3>Replacing jewels</h3>
<div>
    Most jewels are one time use only and shatter (get destroyed) if you try to take them out/replace them. <br>
    Premium jewels that you get as a reward by spending real money are usually Non-Shatter. That means when you try to take it out/replace it, it will unsocket instead of shattering and return to your backpack, ready to be used again, endlessly.
