<section><h3 id="what">What are Talents</h3>
    <div class="section-content"><p>
            Talents are Pet Abilities that help your wizard in battle or out and about adventuring through the Spiral.
            They have all sorts of effects ranging from passive stattistic boost similar to your other gear to active abilities.
            Your pet can naturally learn 5 random Talents out of total 10 that are in it's Talent Pool.
        </p></div></section>

<section><h3 id="pet-statistic"><img class="icon" src="Data/Images/Icon/(Icon) Damage.png" alt="Damage" title="Damage" b-csu5abv9v1 />Pet statistic boosting Talents</h3>
    <div class="section-content"><p>
            Pet statistic boosting Talents boost your pet's stats - <img class="icon" src="Data/Images/Icon/(Icon) Pet Strength.png" alt="Pet Strength" title="Pet Strength" b-csu5abv9v1 />Strength, <img class="icon" src="Data/Images/Icon/(Icon) Pet Intellect.png" alt="Pet Intellect" title="Pet Intellect" b-csu5abv9v1 />Intellect, <img class="icon" src="Data/Images/Icon/(Icon) Pet Agility.png" alt="Pet Agility" title="Pet Agility" b-csu5abv9v1 />Agility, <img class="icon" src="Data/Images/Icon/(Icon) Pet Will.png" alt="Pet Will" title="Pet Will" b-csu5abv9v1 />Will and <img class="icon" src="Data/Images/Icon/(Icon) Pet Power.png" alt="Pet Power" title="Pet Power" b-csu5abv9v1 />Power.
            Each Talent boosts one statistic or mix of two statistics - one boosted usually more prominently.
            
            There are 4 Rarities/Ranks of statistic boosting Talents. Higher it is = stronger the boost.
        </p>
        <ol><li><a href="/tools/pets/ability-prioritizer?type=PetStatisticTalent&amp;rarity=Common">Common</a> = &#x2B;25</li>
            <li><a href="/tools/pets/ability-prioritizer?type=PetStatisticTalent&amp;rarity=Uncommon">Uncommon</a> = &#x2B;40 OR &#x2B;25, &#x2B;15</li>
            <li><a href="/tools/pets/ability-prioritizer?type=PetStatisticTalent&amp;rarity=Rare">Rare</a> = &#x2B;50 OR &#x2B;25, &#x2B;25</li>
            <li><a href="/tools/pets/ability-prioritizer?type=PetStatisticTalent&amp;rarity=Ultra-Rare">Ultra-Rare</a> = &#x2B;65 OR &#x2B;40, &#x2B;25</li></ol>
        <p>
            Since Pet Statistics affect only potency of Wizard statistic boosting Talents, they are useless on their own and always paired in Pet builds with other Wizard statistic boosting Talents.
            Similarly, the only desired Pet statistic boosting Talents are usaully Ultra-Rare since they are the strongest and you usually only want one that boosts all your other Talents.
            
            For example, the most popular Talents people put on their pets are Wizard statistic boosting Talents that either boost their damage output (be it <img class="icon" src="Data/Images/Icon/(Icon) Damage.png" alt="Damage" title="Damage" b-csu5abv9v1 />Damage or <img class="icon" src="Data/Images/Icon/(Icon) Armor Piercing.png" alt="Armor Piercing" title="Armor Piercing" b-csu5abv9v1 />Armor Piercing) or <img class="icon" src="Data/Images/Icon/(Icon) Resistance.png" alt="Resistance" title="Resistance" b-csu5abv9v1 />Universal Resistance. All 3 types of these talents use <img class="icon" src="Data/Images/Icon/(Icon) Pet Strength.png" alt="Pet Strength" title="Pet Strength" b-csu5abv9v1 />Strength in their formula to calculate just how much will their boost your wizard's statistics.
            By adding Mighty Talent into the build, most of those talents will you give you +1% more of said statistic (<a href="/tools/pets/statistics-calculator">IF your natural maximum values of your pet&#x27;s statistics are high enough and their current values are also maxed out</a>.
            A direct example of such build is very popular 4 Damage Talents + Mighty often referred to by the community as "Quad Mighty". If your pet's statistics are high enough, Mighty will give +1% to each of those <img class="icon" src="Data/Images/Icon/(Icon) Damage.png" alt="Damage" title="Damage" b-csu5abv9v1 />Damage talents. So total of extra &#x2B;4%<img class="icon" src="Data/Images/Icon/(Icon) Damage.png" alt="Damage" title="Damage" b-csu5abv9v1 /> And if you socket a 5th Damage talent, Mighty will essentially give you &#x2B;5% extra <img class="icon" src="Data/Images/Icon/(Icon) Damage.png" alt="Damage" title="Damage" b-csu5abv9v1 />.
            
            <a href="/guides/pets/jewels#acquiring">Most of the Pet statistic boosting Talents <img class="icon" src="Data/Images/Icon/(Icon) Jewel.png" alt="Jewel" title="Jewel" b-csu5abv9v1 />Jewels are only craftable.</a> The recipe grants you RANDOM <img class="icon" src="Data/Images/Icon/(Icon) Jewel.png" alt="Jewel" title="Jewel" b-csu5abv9v1 />Jewel of said Rarity/Rank. It also requires relatively hard to get in large quantities <img class="icon" src="Data/Images/Icon/(Icon) Reagent.png" alt="Reagent" title="Reagent" b-csu5abv9v1 />Reagent in order to craft.
            This makes them relatively hard to acquire if you want to socket them instead of manifesting them. Especially for new players. So most players prefer to manifest them at all cost if they need them in their build.

    <div class="section-content"><p>
            Active Talents are special Talents that can be, well, activated on command. While other Talents are passive and work without your intervention, active Talents require you to activate them to use their effect.
            There are 2 types of Active Talents - Adventure Talents and Combat Talents.
            Every active talent has a <a href="/guides/pets/statistics#happiness"><img class="icon" src="Data/Images/Icon/(Icon) Pet Happiness.png" alt="Pet Happiness" title="Pet Happiness" b-csu5abv9v1 />Happiness</a> cost associated with it. Every time you use an active talent, it will cost your pet some <a href="/guides/pets/statistics#happiness"><img class="icon" src="Data/Images/Icon/(Icon) Pet Happiness.png" alt="Pet Happiness" title="Pet Happiness" b-csu5abv9v1 />Happiness</a>. You can&#x27;t use an Active Talent if the pet doesn&#x27;t have enough <img class="icon" src="Data/Images/Icon/(Icon) Pet Happiness.png" alt="Pet Happiness" title="Pet Happiness" b-csu5abv9v1 />Happiness.
            Every active talent has a cooldown associated with it. Every time you use an Active Talent, it will go on cooldown. You will have to wait for it to cooldown in order to be able to use another active ability again.
            Most Active Talents start of locked. When you manifest one for the first time, you will have to unlock it first with Tokens if you want to use it. Once you unlock it, it will stay unlocked on all <b>YOUR</b> future offsprings of that pet that inherit the Talent.

            So if you hatch with one of your pets that has an Active Talent unlocked and if the offspring inherits the Talent, it will be unlocked by default when it manifests said Talent.
            This is only true for your pets/offsprings! If another player hatches with one of your pets that has an Active Talent unlocked, unless their pet has the same Talent unlocked already, they will receive an offspring with the talent locked, just how you originally got it for the first time.

            For example, you unlock an Active Talent on Pet A and you hatch it with with another pet and receive an offspring Pet B. If Pet B has inheritted the Talent, it will be unlocked because <b>your</b> parent, Pet A, had it unlocked. Similarly for future generations of Pet B etc.
            HOWEVER, if Pet B does not inherit the talent and let's say you hatch it with one of yout pets that have the Talent locked or they are not your pet, their offspring, Pet C, will have that Talent locked if it inherits it.

                    Reward for reaching 23/355 points in PvP Battle Pass. You will receive 2x Rank 4 Tokens that rotate every Battle Pass.
                    As of writing this guide, we have only seen Spiritual and Elemental Retriever Tokens that rotate back and forth every other Battle Pass.
                </li>
                <li>
                    VERY RARE drop from some of the Gauntlets and their respective Pack in Crown Shop. All these tokens are Rank 4 for specific Combat Talents.
                </li></ul></div>

        <h4 id="adventure">Adventure Talents</h4>
        <div class="section-content"><p>
                These Talents can be used outside combat to command your pet to collect extra items.
                For them to work, you need to be near a Wooden Chest or a Reagent spawn (depends on talent).

                Their cooldown is counted in seconds.
                If your pet has manifested Adventure Talent, it is unlocked, off cooldown, you are near a point of interest and has enough Happiness to cast it, you will see an additional <img class="icon" src="Data/Images/Icon/(Icon) Adventure Pet Power.png" alt="Adventure Pet Power" title="Adventure Pet Power" b-csu5abv9v1 /> button appear in lower left corner above your potions next to your Pet button.

                After you activate it, your pet will walk towards the point of interest and when it gets there they will harvest it, grant you it's rewards + aditional rewards based on the talent and then return to you (don't have to wait for the return, it's just visual).
            </p></div>

        <h4 id="combat">Combat/Will-Cast/WC Talents</h4>
        <div class="section-content"><p>
                These Talents can be used in combat to command your pet to cast specific spell that the Talent gives.
                They always happen right after your turn (except Detonate Trained - that triggers before your turn), but before enemy cheats happen (if your turn triggered them).
                Their cooldown is counted in number of turns. In addition to regular cooldown after each use, they also have starting cooldown before first use, which can differ from their regular cooldown between casts.
                They have limited number of uses per combat. Usually it's 3 uses/combat.

                If your pet has manifested Combat Talent, it is unlocked, off cooldown, has remaining number of uses in that combat and has enough Happiness to cast it, you will see an additional card on the left side next to your regular 7 cards you normally draw in your hand.
                During your turn you can select the card as any normal spell and cast it on your desired target. After you select your target, your turn doesn't end and you can then select card your wizard will play as you normally do.
                You always have to select the Will-Cast spell first. If you select your wizard's card first, your turn will end and the round will begin resolving.
                Other players can't see the Will-Cast intention of your pet during card selection phase, only yours. So if neccessary, you have to communicate it to them via chat that you are about to use it.

                After you activate it, right after (or before) your turn happens, your pet will walk to the middle of the battle circle and cast the spell you have selected. Afte it casts it, it will return to you and the normal flow of battle continues from there.
